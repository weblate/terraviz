 * The output's playback-sync decision layer
 * (`docs/MULTI_MONITOR_PLAN.md` §3 "Playback sync algorithm").
 *
 * The control law itself is `computeSiblingSyncCorrection` in
 * `src/utils/time.ts`, already measured and already tested — an output
 * is just another sibling viewport, so it runs the same law a second
 * globe in a 2-up layout does rather than a simplified one. What lives
 * here is the layer around it: the gates that decide whether a
 * correction can be computed at all, and the translation from a
 * correction into writes on a media element.
 *
 * Split out of the composition below it for the reason `playbackSettle`
 * and `voiceVad` are: this is where the wrong answers live, and it has
 * no business needing a DOM to be tested. `SyncTarget` is the whole
 * surface it touches — five properties and two methods that
 * `HTMLVideoElement` satisfies structurally — so every branch is
 * reachable from a plain object.
 *
 * ## The constants are imported, never restated
 *
 * `SIBLING_HARD_SEEK_THRESHOLD_S`, `SIBLING_MIN_READY_STATE` and
 * `SIBLING_SEEK_EPS_S` all live beside the control law with
 * measurements in their docstrings. An earlier draft of the plan
 * proposed 2000 ms for the hard-seek threshold — 13× the shipped 0.15,
 * and 4× above a value already measured and rejected for being too
 * high. On a control window that is twelve-plus seconds of staggered
 * globes after every scrub; on an 8K sphere in a gallery it is the same
 * error, larger, with nobody able to explain it. A local copy is a copy
 * that drifts from the measurement, so there is none.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not a special case
 *
 * Operator pause, operator seek, and re-entry from out-of-range are all
 * handled by the general path: a pause is the `paused` branch, a seek is
 * a large error that trips `shouldSeek`, and an out-of-range date pins
 * the output to its nearest boundary frame. Only a *dataset* change
 * needs its own path, and that belongs to whoever owns the media
 * element, not here.

 * `C x rate` seconds behind the moment it lands — which means seeking
 * to correct an error *smaller* than that is guaranteed to end further
 * from the target than it started. Do it once per rendered frame and
 * the correction becomes the fault: seek, stall, measure a fresh
 * desync, seek again, forever, with the picture stuttering and the
 * debug HUD reading a permanent dash because every sampled frame is
 * mid-seek.
 *
 * `OUTPUT_SEEK_SETTLE_MS` was the first attempt at this and it only
 * covers the case it assumed — a seek that finishes inside a second and
 * leaves less than `SETTLING_SEEK_THRESHOLD_S` behind. A seek slower
 * than that outlives the window, so the threshold falls back to 150 ms
 * while the error is still measured in seconds, and the loop closes.
 * The field case was a bbox data-encoded forecast published *as
 * uploaded* rather than transcoded: sparse keyframes, so every seek
 * decodes from a distant one, and none of them finished inside the
 * window.
 *
 * Measured rather than assumed, so it costs nothing where seeks are
 * cheap: an asset that seeks in 20 ms yields a floor below the sibling
 * threshold and `Math.max` discards it. `rate` is the primary's, since
 * that is how far the target moves during the stall — an output mirrors
 * one dataset, so the primary's rate *is* the target's rate here rather
