 * Output window entry point.
 *
 * Deliberately thin — the same shape `orbitMain.ts` has over
 * `orbitCharacter/`, so everything worth testing lives in
 * `outputScene.ts`, `outputLink.ts`, `datasetMirror.ts` and
 * `outputSync.ts`, each importable without running a page. What is left
 * here is the composition, and two decisions that only make sense at
 * this level.
 *
 * **The link is optional; the page is not.** `output.html` is also the
 * static fixture the plan's rungs 2-4 render in an ordinary browser, and
 * a scene that refused to draw without Tauri would take that away. So
 * the link is attached only on desktop and its failure costs the link,
 * never the render loop — an output showing a correct idle Earth is a
 * far better failure than a black window.
 *
 * **Playback is steered per frame, not per message.** A diff tells the
 * output where the primary *was* when it was sent; between diffs both
 * clocks keep running. `outputSync` is idempotent in the steady state —
 * inside the hard-seek threshold it only trims the rate — so calling it
 * every frame is what keeps a sphere in step rather than sawtoothing
 * between diffs.
