 * The output window's scene and render loop.
 *
 * `main.ts` is a thin entry over this, the same shape `orbitMain.ts`
 * has over `orbitCharacter/` — so the parts worth testing are
 * importable without running a page.
 *
 * What this builds: a full-bleed canvas whose drawing buffer is a 2:1
 * equirectangular framebuffer, and a loop that draws the sphere
 * through `equirectRtt`'s pass into it. It renders the idle state —
 * the Earth's base diffuse, re-projected — with no dataset and no IPC.
 *
 * That claim is load-bearing and was once false: the sampler was left
 * bound to `null`, so the page rendered black while this comment said
 * otherwise. Black is the worst possible placeholder here, because on
 * an output it is indistinguishable from a dropped upload or a lost
 * context — the exact failure the 1 Hz static floor below exists to
 * make visible. The sampler is now bound to `baseEarthTexture`, which
 * `photorealEarth` loads unconditionally and never leaves null, from
 * the first frame.
 *
 * ## How the sphere reaches the pass, and the part the plan leaves open
 *
 * `equirectRtt` samples **one equirectangular source texture** and
 * re-projects it. It does not rasterise a mesh, and it cannot: the
 * plan's §3 rejects the cubemap-and-convert route outright, and a
 * perspective camera cannot see 360°. Read together with §3's "raycast
 * that direction against the sphere stack, sample each layer's
 * composited texture at the hit point", the equirect shader *is* the
 * renderer.
 *
 * So `photorealEarth` is used here as a **texture provider**, not as a
 * mesh to render: its progressive CDN loader is what fetches the base
 * diffuse the control globe is already showing, at 2K → 4K → 8K, and
 * `baseDiffuseTexture` / `baseEarthTexture` / `onBaseDiffuseChange`
 * are the seam for that. Reusing its loader is what "widen the
 * existing seams rather than introducing parallel ones" buys us; a
 * second Earth-tile loader is exactly the duplicated-and-subtly-wrong
 * work the Prior-art section warns about.
 *
 * **The fork this scaffold left open is now settled**, in the plan's
 * "What the equirect path does to the Earth decoration". Day/night
 * terminator, clouds and night lights live in `photorealEarth`'s
 * *material* rather than in a texture, so they do not arrive for free
 * — but they are cheap rather than a re-derivation: the terminator is
 * `dot(hit, uSunDir)` because the ray-march's hit point on the unit
 * sphere already *is* the surface normal, and the other two are
 * samplers. Specular, atmosphere, ground shadow and the sun sprite do
 * not cross at all, and are not meant to: each depends on a viewer or
 * a silhouette, and an equirectangular unwrap has neither.
 *
 * Of that, only the base diffuse is wired here. Terminator, night
 * lights and clouds are not — which is correct for a loaded dataset
 * (data is lit uniformly, exactly as `globeThumbnail` does it) and
 * still incomplete for the idle Earth. What changed is that finishing
 * it is a known small job against a settled design rather than an open
 * question, and that the gap is now visible: the sphere shows Earth,
 * so a missing terminator reads as a missing terminator instead of
 * hiding inside a black page.

 * straight to the default framebuffer — no `colorspace_fragment`
 * chunk, so nothing re-encodes on the way out — and every constant in
 * `layerStack` is copied from `earthTileLayer`, which grades and
 * composites in sRGB **display** space because it reads the MapLibre
 * framebuffer (see `photorealEarth`'s own note at the contrast knob).
 *
 * Decoded-linear input under display-space constants is a real,
 * measured error and not a subtlety: lit daytime land
 * `rgb(181, 150, 103)` reached the framebuffer as `rgb(112, 68, 31)` —

 * grade; rung 12c's decoration inherited it the same way.
 *
 * So the decode is removed rather than compensated for, which makes
 * every copied constant correct by construction instead of correct
 * after an offsetting transform. The cloud texture already works this
 * way — it is built here by `new Texture(img)` and left at Three's
 * default `NoColorSpace` — so this brings the other two into line with
 * the one that was never wrong.
 *
 * Mutating a texture another module created is the part to be uneasy
 * about. It is safe here because `createPhotorealEarth` builds these
 * per call and this window holds its own instance: VR and Orbit have
 * theirs, and an output page never constructs one of those anyway.
