/**
 * Atmospheric scattering for the equirectangular output, as a
 * one-dimensional lookup.
 *
 * ## Why the output needs this at all
 *
 * Both surfaces start from the same base texture — `earth_diffuse_*`
 * and the control globe's GIBS `BlueMarble_NextGeneration` tiles are
 * the same product, and both have an ocean of `rgb(2, 5, 20)`, which
 * is very nearly black. **Blue Marble's blue is not in Blue Marble.**
 * On the control globe it comes from `earthTileLayer`'s pass 5, whose
 * shell sits at `ATMOSPHERE_RADIUS_FACTOR` (~1.0157) and therefore
 * covers the whole visible disc rather than a limb ring, compositing
 * as `scattered + background x viewTransmittance`. Rayleigh beta is
 * `[0.0058, 0.0135, 0.0331]`, so blue scatters ~5.7x harder than red
 * and the in-scattered term *is* the ocean's colour.
 *
 * Without it an output renders a near-black sea while the operator's
 * globe shows a blue one, which was reported from hardware as "the
 * main application window is much more blue".
 *
 * ## Why it is one variable, not a ray-march
 *
 * The plan's decoration table rules out "atmosphere shells" on an
 * unwrap. That is right about the *limb* and wrong about the *disc
 * tint*, and this module is the part that crosses.
 *
 * Fix the view direction to nadir — straight down at every point,
 * which is the one choice an unwrap can make without inventing a
 * viewer. Then for surface point `P` (a unit vector, and on this path
 * the ray-march's own hit point), take the ray from the top of
 * atmosphere above `P` pointing at `-P`. Every term of
 * `computeAtmosphereScattering` collapses:
 *
 * - `samplePos = P * (ATMOSPHERE_RADIUS - t)`, so
 *   `normalize(samplePos) === P` at every step.
 * - The sun-transmittance lookup keys on
 *   `dot(normalize(samplePos), sunDir)`, which is therefore
 *   `dot(P, sunDir)` — **constant down the whole column**.
 * - The view-side optical depths depend only on altitude, so only
 *   on `t`.
 * - Both phase functions key on `dot(rayDir, sunDir)`, which is
 *   `-dot(P, sunDir)`.
 *
 * So the entire result is a function of the single scalar
 * `s = dot(P, sunDir)`. Not approximately — exactly, for this
 * ray-march, which is single-scatter with no ground-albedo coupling
 * (read the loop in `buildAtmosphereRaymarchGlsl`: nothing in it
 * reads the surface).
 *
 * And `s` is a number the output shader already computes:
 * `earthNightFactor` takes it. So the scattering costs one texture
 * lookup into the 256x1 LUT this module builds, not a per-fragment
 * integration of 8.4 million columns.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not bring across
 *
 * Specular glint, the ground shadow and the sun sprite stay out, and
 * the reason is sharper than "they depend on a viewer". Ask what each
 * effect *becomes* at nadir: scattering becomes a smooth global
 * function of sun angle, which is meaningful everywhere. Specular
 * becomes a fixed bright spot at the subsolar point — the same "glare
 * spot painted onto a physical sphere" the plan rules out, just
 * reached by a different route. That is the test, and only this one
 * passes it.
 *
 * ## Two honest limits
 *
 * **Single-scatter.** At high sun-zenith angles the real sky is
 * brighter than this. The control globe has exactly the same
 * limitation, which is the point: the two agree because they share
 * these constants, rather than because either is right.
 *
 * **Nadir is a choice.** The control globe shows one viewer's
 * scattering, so the two match near the sub-viewer point and diverge
 * toward its limb. An unwrap has no viewer to match; nadir is what a
 * satellite directly overhead sees, which is the most defensible
 * reading of what every point of an unwrap is showing.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: no DOM, no GL, no Three. The constants and
 * the transmittance LUT are **imported** from
 * `services/atmosphereConstants` and `services/atmosphereLut` rather
 * than copied — unlike the four decoration scalars in `layerStack`,
 * which had to be hand-copied because their home imports MapLibre.
 * `atmosphereConstants` imports nothing at all, and `atmosphereLut`
 * imports only from it, so sharing them costs the output bundle
 * nothing and removes a whole class of drift.
