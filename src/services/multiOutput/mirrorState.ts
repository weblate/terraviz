 * east around the globe three times and it reads 900-odd, not 180.
 * `OperatorCamera.lon` is documented −180..180 and
 * `cameraOffsetForCamera` derives a *direction vector* from it, so an
 * un-normalised value does not merely look odd — it aims the output's
 * camera somewhere the operator is not, and it gets further wrong the
 * longer they pan.
 *
 * **Latitude can exceed the poles** at some pitches, and a camera
 * outside the sphere is exactly what `MAX_CAMERA_OFFSET` exists to
 * prevent; clamping here keeps the shader's no-miss-branch assumption
 * true at the source rather than relying on the clamp downstream.
 *
 * **A non-finite value poisons everything it touches.** A `NaN` zoom
 * reaches the shader as a `NaN` offset, and every ray misses; the
 * output goes black, which is the one failure the 1 Hz floor exists to
 * make visible. Falling back to the last good value is not possible
 * here (this is pure), so it falls back to the centred default, which
