/**
 * Persisted multi-monitor output configuration
 * (`docs/MULTI_MONITOR_PLAN.md` §3 "Persistence", delivery rung 10).
 *
 * Two jobs, kept in one module because they share a schema and nothing
 * else in the codebase needs either half:
 *
 * 1. **Storage.** Read and write `localStorage['sos-multi-output-config']`,
 *    fail-closed, behind a `StorageLike` seam so a test drives it without
 *    a browser and the manager never touches `localStorage` directly.
 * 2. **Monitor matching.** Decide whether a persisted output's monitor is
 *    still present — the rule with real correctness content, and the
 *    reason this is a module rather than a few lines inside the manager.
 *
 * **A name-only match is not a match.** Windows reports `\\.\DISPLAY1`,
 * `\\.\DISPLAY2`, `\\.\DISPLAY3` — names assigned *positionally* and
 * reassigned across an unplug, a replug or a driver update. Matching on
 * the name alone can restore an output onto a physically different
 * monitor while looking like it worked, and on an installation that is a
 * projector showing the wrong thing to an audience with nothing on
 * screen to say so. So a match requires the name **and** the signed
 * physical origin; anything less is a monitor we do not recognise, and
 * the entry is skipped and logged rather than guessed at. Restoring
 * nothing is a better failure than restoring the wrong monitor.
 *
 * Origins are stored **signed and as reported** — physical pixels,
 * negative `x` included, exactly as `availableMonitors()` gave them. A
 * value that has been through a logical conversion cannot be compared
 * against a fresh `Monitor.position` on a HiDPI desk, and nothing in the
 * placement path wants the converted form anyway.
 *
 * Pure apart from the injected storage: no DOM, no Tauri, no timers.
